// What a plan is allowed to spend on Claude in a month, and the check that
// stops a customer from quietly costing more than they pay.
//
// The unit is DOLLARS, not runs. Runs vary from $0.30 to $9 depending on how
// much code a merge touched, so "300 merges" is not a budget — it's a guess
// that happens to be right for small repos and ruinous for large ones.
//
// The existing MCP free-trial counters (McpUsageEvent) count forever and never
// reset, which is why a free trial there can never come back. These are windowed
// to the calendar month on purpose.
// A plan is two things: how much Claude it may spend in a month, and WHICH
// parts of Olivia it may use. Both live here, in one table, so "what does this
// plan include?" is answered by reading four lines instead of grepping for
// plan checks scattered across controllers.
//
// features: api = endpoint docs, tests and bug hunter on connected repos.
//           mcp = the MCP side (tools, docs, tests, bug hunter).
//           automation = the E2E / Playwright side.
//           watchers = the agent that fires on merge, for both api and mcp.
// mcpQuotas caps how many times a month the MCP actions can run, on top of the
// money. It exists for the free trial: someone evaluating the product should
// see it work, not burn a month's budget in one afternoon. Paid plans set it to
// null — their only ceiling is the dollar budget.
